  `<p>I’m inviting you all to participate in a group challenge of practicing 
    an abundance consciousness, changing your thinking to allow you to get more of what you 
    really want in life, whether it’s love, money, health or opportunity, for 21 days. 
    I’ve been participating in a separate group and this is part of my assignment. 
    Some of you may have been invited by others, please kindly remove yourself from the 
    group if you don’t want to do it again. It’s been quite fun and a great practice to think 
    about what I really want to create and set an intention to manifest.</p>
    <p>Your activity in this group is limited to posting “Day 1 done, day 2 done, etc.” It’s 
    not a community forum except to receive the prompts and instructions that I will be 
    forwarding daily.</p>
    <p>If you can’t or don’t want to participate, you can leave this group at any time. 
    I know adding one more thing to our lives can feel like a lot and it’s not for everyone.</p>
    <p>For those who want to participate, here’s the info: This is Deepak Chopra's powerful 21 
    Day Meditation. The exercises can be powerful, and exactly what one might naturally do in 
    order to create what they want and Deepak breaks it down in a simple way.</p>
    <p>This program is meant to support you in cultivating the habit of abundance.</p>
    <p>I am only the messenger passing along the information and intentions as prescribed by 
    Deepak Chopra’s program. The tasks are shared exactly as provided by the program. 
    The goal is to get to know yourself better, change/clarify beliefs and attitudes.</p>
    <p>We will work together by committing to a 21 day practice. (As you may already know, 
    studies show it takes 21 days to form a new habit).</p>
    <p>TIME COMMITMENT:<br>
    -10 minutes for the meditation at a convenient time<br>
    -15-30 minutes to complete the task of the day.</p>
    <p>Participating in this practice will also support you in realizing your blocks, fears and 
    limiting beliefs in the area of abundance. As we realize these blocks, we can then actively 
    work to heal them by opening up an infinite source of abundance.</p>
    <p>I will send a task and a meditation each day for you to complete.</p>
    <p>Detailed instructions for the group and our journey together:<br>
    I am sending the instructions a day early so you have time to get a journal to dedicate 
    solely to this practice.</p>
    <p>Please read this post carefully - it contains all the rules of our journey.</p>
    Rules and Arrangements:<br>
    After the publication of the daily task, you have 24 hours to complete it. All tasks I will 
    lay out the night before.<br>
    If in the task you need to write something, write by hand, with a pen or pencil on paper, 
    ideally in a separate notebook.<br>
    Before you write, come to a calm state. Using slow deep breathing or meditation. You can 
    complete the task after Deepak Chopra’s meditation.<br>
    Please send questions in private message to me. No need to leave comments or "thanks" in 
    the group.<br>
    Be fully focused on the daily task, allocate time and space for it.<br>
    If you cannot participate, or keep the rhythm of the program, please remove yourself from 
    the group. It is important to maintain the flow so that the energy input into this process 
    does not dissipate.<br>
    After completing the daily task, please write the completion statement. For example, "Day 1 
    Done" as a confirmation for all of you. There will be days in which I will ask you to leave 
    other comments.<br>
    If the task is not completed within a day, please leave the group.<br>
    Every day there will be a published task, affirmation of the day, a link to a Deepak Chopra 
    meditation.</p>`,
  `<p>If you read all the rules and agree to follow them, please write in the comment "Day 0 done."</p>
    <p>I also recommend writing the phrase in a notebook and return to it several times, the more the 
    better.</p>
    <p>Mahatma Gandhi taught us to remember our thoughts generate words, words generate actions, 
    actions generate habits, habits generate character, and character breeds destiny.</p>`,
  `<p>"Starting today, I constantly attract abundance with my thoughts."<br>
    This should also be written in your notebook and remembered during the day as often as possible.</p>`,

        Everyone who has influenced you, and contributed to your growth and development.<br>
        The list must have at least 50 names.</p>
        <p>In the process of making a list, think about why you chose the person. What has changed in your
        life for the better?<br>
        Move calmly and thoughtfully.  Remember the best things about each person in the list and what
        they bring into your life.<br>

        Remember: if you are finding it too challenging to commit, please remove yourself from the chat.
        No judgment. It is to maintain the energy and flow of abundance.</p>`,
  `<p>It may seem simple to some people but not to others. Remember that if it’s difficult for you
        to perform any task, there is a block - an obstacle in your mind on the path towards attaining
        abundance. Just be aware of this and stick with it!<br><br>

        Write all of your debts in your notebook. Debt on a bank account, credit cards, loans, debts to
        individuals, court debts - all of your debts, of any kind. No need to record the amount,
        only who is owed and for what.<br>
        For example: a mortgage, a car loan, a debt to master card for a gift, etc.<br><br>

        After that, make a list of all your monthly payments. Again without numbers, just listing.<br>
        For example: renting an apartment, electricity, gas, land tax, water, an accountant, a
        kindergarten, a music tutor, a gym, a manicure, insurance, gasoline, etc.<br>
        Everything you have to pay each month should be recorded.<br><br>

        In general, create a complete list of sources of your monthly expenses, constant and changing.
        For some, this list will be extensive.  Give yourself time to calmly walk through all the areas
        of your life in which you pay money. You may need to add what you remember throughout the day.
        <br><br>
        Also answer the question, “What does abundance mean to you?” If you want, you can write the answer in
        your notebook.

In your everyday life, spend more time in nature, soaking up her beauty and watching how abundance manifests itself everywhere.  Immerse yourself in the energy of music, uplifting and inspiring stories, optimistic like-minded people around you.

By doing this, you will see how the field of all possibilities is widely revealed right in front of you.

  `,
  `<p>Today's task is based on the law of energy exchange.
<br><br>
  Everything is made of energy.<br><br>
  A person constantly exchanges energy with other people.<br><br>
  
  The first principle of this law is that balance must be maintained in everything.<br><br>
  
  If someone departs then someone arrives.  Energy does not disappear anywhere.<br><br>
  
  If you sent something outside, then something will return to you.<br><br>
  
  If you want to achieve a balance in everything, learn to give and receive equally. Or even better, just give more...
  <br><br>
  
  Today's exercise is completely devoted to the exchange, returns.  And a turning point in our journey. 
  <br><br>
  From today, you will be responsible for your OWN abundance group.
  <br><br>
It does not have to be big.  Even 2-3 people is enough!
<br><br>
Every day, you will conduct your group through tasks from 0 to 21 days, just like you get them from me and continue to receive.
<br><br>
Today you are just creating your group and send task 0 in it, and the following day will be the first day (according to your time zone)!
<br><br>
How do you open a group? 
<br><br>
Choose a profile photo that symbolizes abundance for you.
<br><br>
Name the group "21 Days of Abundance" or other name and invite your friends.
<br><br>
It is important to explain the intention of the group and say that there will be daily tasks. You can copy from my text and just forward it to those in your contacts.
<br><br>
Especially invite people whose interest you question. Do not decide for other people whether it will be interesting to them or not.
<br><br>
Perhaps it is this flow of plenty that they need now.  And you will be the conductor of abundance in the lives of these people!
<br><br>
Potential participants must be prepared to become part of such a process.
<br><br>
Friends may drop out of your group and you may be inclined to convince them to stay but don’t persuade anyone. Don’t impose.  Everyone has free will and they are free to make their own choice. 
<br><br>
Remember, you will need to send meditations and tasks every day and make sure that only those who perform the task remain in the group, maintain the group rules and the general flow.
<br><br>
For some, this task may seem difficult due to the extra effort that will have to be made, or fear of the unknown or the fear of how it looks.
<br><br>
It helps to realize one’s fears, doubts and limitations that interfere with growth.
<br><br>
It’s easy to lead your group and very rewarding (I promise!)
<br><br>
You only need to copy the messages that I am sending you. You can add something from yourself & remember to alter the days/due dates where needed. If you do not know what to add, just send my messages :)
<br><br>
Let the love in your heart expand, because you can contribute to the awareness of others.

"I, (full name, last name), am starting a new relationship with money today.

Money is good, pure, useful and necessary for my prosperity and growth, for my satisfaction and abundance.
<br><br>
Money brings positive things to my life. The success that I experience in life brings money and happiness for me and my loved ones.
<br><br>
I deserve to flourish and have a lot of money.
<br><br>
Money is my friend and the value of my investments is growing every day.
<br><br>
Success and money accompany me, here and now.
<br><br>
I ask my parents, grandparents, and ancestors who had difficulties due to lack of money, to bless me as I choose to live differently.
<br><br>
And I ask my parents, grandparents, and ancestors who lived in abundance and prosperity to inspire me”
<br><br>
Write this statement 10 times in your notebook by hand.
<br><br>
After that record yourself reading this statement with sense of attachment on audio or video. 
<br><br>
This task is the longest in our journey, it can take about an hour.  Before performing - sit comfortably, relax, inhale several times slowly and deeply through the nose and exhale as slowly through the nose.
<br><br>
Our brain learns through repetition and rehearsal.
<br><br>
Therefore, tune in to connect with what you will write.

  In today's meditation, we will discuss the Law of Karma, or conscious decision-making, and see how, by making the right choices, we can bring much more good into our lives.

  In today's meditation, we will look at the Law of Least Effort and how it can support you in being unattached to the outcome of your deepest desires and intentions.

  When your actions are motivated by love, your energy is multiplied and accumulated.

  The release of this energy allows you to redirect it and use it to create everything that you want to create.
