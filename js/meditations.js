  `<p>I’m inviting you all to participate in a group challenge of practicing 
    an abundance consciousness, changing your thinking to allow you to get more of what you 
    really want in life, whether it’s love, money, health or opportunity, for 21 days. 
    I’ve been participating in a separate group and this is part of my assignment. 
    Some of you may have been invited by others, please kindly remove yourself from the 
    group if you don’t want to do it again. It’s been quite fun and a great practice to think 
    about what I really want to create and set an intention to manifest.</p>
    <p>Your activity in this group is limited to posting “Day 1 done, day 2 done, etc.” It’s 
    not a community forum except to receive the prompts and instructions that I will be 
    forwarding daily.</p>
    <p>If you can’t or don’t want to participate, you can leave this group at any time. 
    I know adding one more thing to our lives can feel like a lot and it’s not for everyone.</p>
    <p>For those who want to participate, here’s the info: This is Deepak Chopra's powerful 21 
    Day Meditation. The exercises can be powerful, and exactly what one might naturally do in 
    order to create what they want and Deepak breaks it down in a simple way.</p>
    <p>This program is meant to support you in cultivating the habit of abundance.</p>
    <p>I am only the messenger passing along the information and intentions as prescribed by 
    Deepak Chopra’s program. The tasks are shared exactly as provided by the program. 
    The goal is to get to know yourself better, change/clarify beliefs and attitudes.</p>
    <p>We will work together by committing to a 21 day practice. (As you may already know, 
    studies show it takes 21 days to form a new habit).</p>
    <p>TIME COMMITMENT:<br>
    -10 minutes for the meditation at a convenient time<br>
    -15-30 minutes to complete the task of the day.</p>
    <p>Participating in this practice will also support you in realizing your blocks, fears and 
    limiting beliefs in the area of abundance. As we realize these blocks, we can then actively 
    work to heal them by opening up an infinite source of abundance.</p>
    <p>I will send a task and a meditation each day for you to complete.</p>
    <p>Detailed instructions for the group and our journey together:<br>
    I am sending the instructions a day early so you have time to get a journal to dedicate 
    solely to this practice.</p>
    <p>Please read this post carefully - it contains all the rules of our journey.</p>
    Rules and Arrangements:<br>
    After the publication of the daily task, you have 24 hours to complete it. All tasks I will 
    lay out the night before.<br>
    If in the task you need to write something, write by hand, with a pen or pencil on paper, 
    ideally in a separate notebook.<br>
    Before you write, come to a calm state. Using slow deep breathing or meditation. You can 
    complete the task after Deepak Chopra’s meditation.<br>
    Please send questions in private message to me. No need to leave comments or "thanks" in 
    the group.<br>
    Be fully focused on the daily task, allocate time and space for it.<br>
    If you cannot participate, or keep the rhythm of the program, please remove yourself from 
    the group. It is important to maintain the flow so that the energy input into this process 
    does not dissipate.<br>
    After completing the daily task, please write the completion statement. For example, "Day 1 
    Done" as a confirmation for all of you. There will be days in which I will ask you to leave 
    other comments.<br>
    If the task is not completed within a day, please leave the group.<br>
    Every day there will be a published task, affirmation of the day, a link to a Deepak Chopra 
    meditation.</p>`,
  `<p>If you read all the rules and agree to follow them, please write in the comment "Day 0 done."</p>
    <p>I also recommend writing the phrase in a notebook and return to it several times, the more the 
    better.</p>
    <p>Mahatma Gandhi taught us to remember our thoughts generate words, words generate actions, 
    actions generate habits, habits generate character, and character breeds destiny.</p>`,
  `<p>"Starting today, I constantly attract abundance with my thoughts."<br>
    This should also be written in your notebook and remembered during the day as often as possible.</p>`,
  "",
  "",
  `<p>1. Read all the rules.<br>
    2. Write the phrase of the day in your notebook: "Starting today, I constantly attract abundance 
    with my thoughts." Remember it during the day.<br>
    3. Comment "Day 0 done." in the group.</p>`

let med1 = new Meditation(
  `<p>IMPORTANT: For those who have not joined and tapped in with a “Day 0 done” by tomorrow will
        be removed from the group.<br>
        You can leave the group if you decide not to continue.<br>
        I highly recommend doing the meditation and the task at the beginning of the day, if possible.
        It sets the tone and changes the course of the day!</p>`,
  `<p>In your new notebook, make a list of 50 people that have influenced your life.<br>
        They can be both living and already departed people, your relatives, friends, and celebrities,
        writers and personalities whom you do not necessarily know personally.
        Everyone who has influenced you, and contributed to your growth and development.<br>
        The list must have at least 50 names.</p>
        <p>In the process of making a list, think about why you chose the person. What has changed in your
        life for the better?<br>
        Move calmly and thoughtfully.  Remember the best things about each person in the list and what
        they bring into your life.<br>
        Trust in the process!<br>
        Put your phone in airplane mode while doing this so that no one will disturb you.<br>
        Your list may be more than 50 people. But not less!</p>`,
  `<p>"Today I behold the abundance that surrounds me"<br>
        This should also be written in your notebook and remembered during the day as often as possible.</p>`,
  `<p>The meditation can be done before or after the task. It's up to you!<br>
        This is the Mantra you will repeat during meditation:<br>
        So Hum<br>
        So Hum</p>`,
  `<a href="https://youtu.be/en1kIch5KNE">https://youtu.be/en1kIch5KNE</a>`,
  `<p>1. Meditation: Listen to the audio. Repeat the mantra.<br>
            2. Write the phrase of the day in your notebook:
            "Today I behold all the abundance that surrounds me." Remember it during the day.<br>
            3. Complete the assignment in a notebook - make a list of 50 people who have influenced your development.</p>
            <p>You have 24 hours to complete the task!</p>`

  `<p>Kudos to you all whom have committed to this practice & already completed your first day.<br>
        Remember: if you are finding it too challenging to commit, please remove yourself from the chat.
        No judgment. It is to maintain the energy and flow of abundance.</p>`,
  `<p>It may seem simple to some people but not to others. Remember that if it’s difficult for you
        to perform any task, there is a block - an obstacle in your mind on the path towards attaining
        abundance. Just be aware of this and stick with it!<br><br>

        Write all of your debts in your notebook. Debt on a bank account, credit cards, loans, debts to
        individuals, court debts - all of your debts, of any kind. No need to record the amount,
        only who is owed and for what.<br>
        For example: a mortgage, a car loan, a debt to master card for a gift, etc.<br><br>

        After that, make a list of all your monthly payments. Again without numbers, just listing.<br>
        For example: renting an apartment, electricity, gas, land tax, water, an accountant, a
        kindergarten, a music tutor, a gym, a manicure, insurance, gasoline, etc.<br>
        Everything you have to pay each month should be recorded.<br><br>

        In general, create a complete list of sources of your monthly expenses, constant and changing.
        For some, this list will be extensive.  Give yourself time to calmly walk through all the areas
        of your life in which you pay money. You may need to add what you remember throughout the day.
        <br><br>
        Also answer the question, “What does abundance mean to you?” If you want, you can write the answer in
        your notebook.
        </p>`,
  `<p>Write this phrase of the day in your notebook:<br>
        "I create my personal abundance from an infinite source."</p>`,

  `<p>Welcome to our third day!</p>`,
  `<p>Draw notes, checks, stocks, bonds, coins, and any other means of payment in your notebook.
        Draw enough to pay off all the debts and expenses you wrote down yesterday.<br><br>

        You have complete freedom to create and draw a solution.  We draw in order to make it possible
        to pay for everything you need in the universe! Use your imagination, your creativity, pens,
        pencils, paints etc. Draw bills, coins, wads of money, bags of money, money raining down -
        whatever you want!<br><br>

        Remember, this is not a drawing lesson, but about allowing yourself to create your reality and
        let it manifest into your life. While you are drawing, feel the satisfaction of creating a
        balance between debts and expenses and the means of payment that you create - as if it were a
        real payment of your expenses and debts.</p>`,
