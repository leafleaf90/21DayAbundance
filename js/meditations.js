  `<p>I’m inviting you all to participate in a group challenge of practicing 
    an abundance consciousness, changing your thinking to allow you to get more of what you 
    really want in life, whether it’s love, money, health or opportunity, for 21 days. 
    I’ve been participating in a separate group and this is part of my assignment. 
    Some of you may have been invited by others, please kindly remove yourself from the 
    group if you don’t want to do it again. It’s been quite fun and a great practice to think 
    about what I really want to create and set an intention to manifest.</p>
    <p>Your activity in this group is limited to posting “Day 1 done, day 2 done, etc.” It’s 
    not a community forum except to receive the prompts and instructions that I will be 
    forwarding daily.</p>
    <p>If you can’t or don’t want to participate, you can leave this group at any time. 
    I know adding one more thing to our lives can feel like a lot and it’s not for everyone.</p>
    <p>For those who want to participate, here’s the info: This is Deepak Chopra's powerful 21 
    Day Meditation. The exercises can be powerful, and exactly what one might naturally do in 
    order to create what they want and Deepak breaks it down in a simple way.</p>
    <p>This program is meant to support you in cultivating the habit of abundance.</p>
    <p>I am only the messenger passing along the information and intentions as prescribed by 
    Deepak Chopra’s program. The tasks are shared exactly as provided by the program. 
    The goal is to get to know yourself better, change/clarify beliefs and attitudes.</p>
    <p>We will work together by committing to a 21 day practice. (As you may already know, 
    studies show it takes 21 days to form a new habit).</p>
    <p>TIME COMMITMENT:<br>
    -10 minutes for the meditation at a convenient time<br>
    -15-30 minutes to complete the task of the day.</p>
    <p>Participating in this practice will also support you in realizing your blocks, fears and 
    limiting beliefs in the area of abundance. As we realize these blocks, we can then actively 
    work to heal them by opening up an infinite source of abundance.</p>
    <p>I will send a task and a meditation each day for you to complete.</p>
    <p>Detailed instructions for the group and our journey together:<br>
    I am sending the instructions a day early so you have time to get a journal to dedicate 
    solely to this practice.</p>
    <p>Please read this post carefully - it contains all the rules of our journey.</p>
    Rules and Arrangements:<br>
    After the publication of the daily task, you have 24 hours to complete it. All tasks I will 
    lay out the night before.<br>
    If in the task you need to write something, write by hand, with a pen or pencil on paper, 
    ideally in a separate notebook.<br>
    Before you write, come to a calm state. Using slow deep breathing or meditation. You can 
    complete the task after Deepak Chopra’s meditation.<br>
    Please send questions in private message to me. No need to leave comments or "thanks" in 
    the group.<br>
    Be fully focused on the daily task, allocate time and space for it.<br>
    If you cannot participate, or keep the rhythm of the program, please remove yourself from 
    the group. It is important to maintain the flow so that the energy input into this process 
    does not dissipate.<br>
    After completing the daily task, please write the completion statement. For example, "Day 1 
    Done" as a confirmation for all of you. There will be days in which I will ask you to leave 
    other comments.<br>
    If the task is not completed within a day, please leave the group.<br>
    Every day there will be a published task, affirmation of the day, a link to a Deepak Chopra 
    meditation.</p>`,
  `<p>If you read all the rules and agree to follow them, please write in the comment "Day 0 done."</p>
    <p>I also recommend writing the phrase in a notebook and return to it several times, the more the 
    better.</p>
    <p>Mahatma Gandhi taught us to remember our thoughts generate words, words generate actions, 
    actions generate habits, habits generate character, and character breeds destiny.</p>`,
  `<p>"Starting today, I constantly attract abundance with my thoughts."<br>
    This should also be written in your notebook and remembered during the day as often as possible.</p>`,

        Everyone who has influenced you, and contributed to your growth and development.<br>
        The list must have at least 50 names.</p>
        <p>In the process of making a list, think about why you chose the person. What has changed in your
        life for the better?<br>
        Move calmly and thoughtfully.  Remember the best things about each person in the list and what
        they bring into your life.<br>

  `<p>It may seem simple to some people but not to others. Remember that if it’s difficult for you
        to perform any task, there is a block - an obstacle in your mind on the path towards attaining
        abundance. Just be aware of this and stick with it!<br><br>

        Write all of your debts in your notebook. Debt on a bank account, credit cards, loans, debts to
        individuals, court debts - all of your debts, of any kind. No need to record the amount,

        For example: renting an apartment, electricity, gas, land tax, water, an accountant, a
        kindergarten, a music tutor, a gym, a manicure, insurance, gasoline, etc.<br>
        Everything you have to pay each month should be recorded.<br><br>

        In general, create a complete list of sources of your monthly expenses, constant and changing.
        For some, this list will be extensive.  Give yourself time to calmly walk through all the areas
        of your life in which you pay money. You may need to add what you remember throughout the day.
        <br><br>
        Also answer the question, “What does abundance mean to you?” If you want, you can write the answer in
        your notebook.

In your everyday life, spend more time in nature, soaking up her beauty and watching how abundance manifests itself everywhere.  Immerse yourself in the energy of music, uplifting and inspiring stories, optimistic like-minded people around you.

By doing this, you will see how the field of all possibilities is widely revealed right in front of you.

  `,
  `<p>Today's task is based on the law of energy exchange.
<br><br>
  Everything is made of energy.<br><br>
  A person constantly exchanges energy with other people.<br><br>
  
  The first principle of this law is that balance must be maintained in everything.<br><br>
  
  If someone departs then someone arrives.  Energy does not disappear anywhere.<br><br>
  
  If you sent something outside, then something will return to you.<br><br>
  
  If you want to achieve a balance in everything, learn to give and receive equally. Or even better, just give more...
  <br><br>
  
  Today's exercise is completely devoted to the exchange, returns.  And a turning point in our journey. 
  <br><br>
  From today, you will be responsible for your OWN abundance group.
  <br><br>
It does not have to be big.  Even 2-3 people is enough!
<br><br>
Every day, you will conduct your group through tasks from 0 to 21 days, just like you get them from me and continue to receive.
<br><br>
Today you are just creating your group and send task 0 in it, and the following day will be the first day (according to your time zone)!
<br><br>
How do you open a group? 
<br><br>
Choose a profile photo that symbolizes abundance for you.
<br><br>
Name the group "21 Days of Abundance" or other name and invite your friends.
<br><br>
It is important to explain the intention of the group and say that there will be daily tasks. You can copy from my text and just forward it to those in your contacts.
<br><br>
Especially invite people whose interest you question. Do not decide for other people whether it will be interesting to them or not.
<br><br>
Perhaps it is this flow of plenty that they need now.  And you will be the conductor of abundance in the lives of these people!
<br><br>
Potential participants must be prepared to become part of such a process.
<br><br>
Friends may drop out of your group and you may be inclined to convince them to stay but don’t persuade anyone. Don’t impose.  Everyone has free will and they are free to make their own choice. 
<br><br>
Remember, you will need to send meditations and tasks every day and make sure that only those who perform the task remain in the group, maintain the group rules and the general flow.
<br><br>
For some, this task may seem difficult due to the extra effort that will have to be made, or fear of the unknown or the fear of how it looks.
<br><br>
It helps to realize one’s fears, doubts and limitations that interfere with growth.
<br><br>
It’s easy to lead your group and very rewarding (I promise!)
<br><br>
You only need to copy the messages that I am sending you. You can add something from yourself & remember to alter the days/due dates where needed. If you do not know what to add, just send my messages :)
<br><br>
Let the love in your heart expand, because you can contribute to the awareness of others.

Money is good, pure, useful and necessary for my prosperity and growth, for my satisfaction and abundance.
<br><br>
Money brings positive things to my life. The success that I experience in life brings money and happiness for me and my loved ones.
<br><br>
I deserve to flourish and have a lot of money.
<br><br>
Money is my friend and the value of my investments is growing every day.
<br><br>
Success and money accompany me, here and now.
<br><br>
I ask my parents, grandparents, and ancestors who had difficulties due to lack of money, to bless me as I choose to live differently.
<br><br>
And I ask my parents, grandparents, and ancestors who lived in abundance and prosperity to inspire me”
<br><br>
Write this statement 10 times in your notebook by hand.
<br><br>
After that record yourself reading this statement with sense of attachment on audio or video.

This task is the longest in our journey, it can take about an hour.  Before performing - sit comfortably, relax, inhale several times slowly and deeply through the nose and exhale as slowly through the nose.

Our brain learns through repetition and rehearsal.
<br><br>
Therefore, tune in to connect with what you will write.

  In today's meditation, we will discuss the Law of Karma, or conscious decision-making, and see how, by making the right choices, we can bring much more good into our lives.

  When you make any choice, you may ask yourself: how will this choice bring more happiness and more abundance to my life and those around me?  Having asked this question, shift your attention to the heart, and the answer will immediately become clear.

  In today's meditation, we will look at the Law of Least Effort and how it can support you in being unattached to the outcome of your deepest desires and intentions.

  When your actions are motivated by love, your energy is multiplied and accumulated.

  The release of this energy allows you to redirect it and use it to create everything that you want to create.

  When your spirit is your inner point of reference, all the power of love is at your disposal.  And you can use this energy creatively, moving toward abundance and evolution.

We will learn the Law of Detachment. 
<br><br>
Abundance comes in many forms. As long as you create through desires that benefit the whole world, you can get whatever you want.
<br><br>
Symbols of abundance: 
<br>
A big house, a new car or elaborate jewelry will bring waves of excitement into your life.  And yet, these symbols may mean sacrificing the ocean for the sake of several transient waves.
<br>
Live, overflowing with an abundance of love, passion, creativity and significance, and then these symbols themselves will “chase” you.
<br><br>
QUESTION N ° 1: What symbols of abundance do you dream of?
<br><br>
QUESTION N ° 2: How could they improve both your life and others?
<br><br>
QUESTION N ° 3: How else will such abundance positively affect your life?

  `<p>Congrats for making it to week 2!
    <br><br>
    I know it’s not easy to stay consistent but you’re doing it  and just by showing up means so much.
    <br><br>
    We are heading into our last week together.
    <br><br>
Abundance and the Law of Dharma
<br><br>
Today we are completing the second week of the 21 day meditation program of the Chopra Center - KEY TO ABUNDANCE.
<br><br>
Over the past week, we have examined abundance in terms of the principles described in the book, The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success, from the Law of Pure Potentiality to the Dharma Law today.
<br><br>
When your life is full of true purpose, your dharma, or abundance, rushes toward you easily and effortlessly.
<br><br>
As the saying goes: “Do what you love, the money will be.”
<br><br>
It is not only about material wealth, but also about satisfaction, confidence, optimism, joy and abundance! And all of its manifestations that will come to you if you live your true purpose in life.
<br><br>
QUESTION N ° 1: What brings you the most joy?
<br><br>
QUESTION N ° 2: How do you feel this joy in your everyday life and in your current work?
<br><br>
QUESTION N ° 3: How can you approach a life full of joy, by living your Dharma or life's dream?
  </p>`,
  `<p>
  Enjoy this day, noticing the generous gifts of the world that surround us, seek us, and ask us to notice and accept and 
  give thanks for each of them.
  <br><br>

  At the end of the day, write down at least three paths / sources through which abundance has come to you today.
  <br><br>

  Even if it was something very small.

  Meditate so that the image of this person comes to you.

  More than one person may appear but today we write a letter to only one.
  <br><br>
  Before you sit down to write, cleanse yourself of negative emotions towards this person. If you still have resentment or anger, you can separately write down all these feelings for them on paper and then tear the sheet to shreds.
  <br><br>
  It is important not to feel hostility towards a person when you write a letter of thanks to them.

Make a list of things that you wanted to do, but postponed. This could be because of other priorities or because of fear of hurting someone, or failing. Regardless of the reason, these are things that you still plan on doing. 
<br><br>
The idea of ​​writing this list is to forgive yourself for everything that you have not done in your life.
<br><br>
For each line on your list, write a text of forgiveness based on examples below: 
<br><br>
* I, full name, forgive myself absolutely and lovingly for not setting my boundaries
 <br><br>
* I, full name, forgive myself absolutely and lovingly that I did not show my vulnerability.

  `<p>Today we look at how we can live carefree - free from judgment and anxiety, focusing on the joy and perfection of what is right now.

  By meditating and plunging into the awareness of the present moment, you understand that it is at this moment, everything is perfect and is what it should be.
  <br><br>
  And that any problems that you have are transient and temporary.
  <br><br>
  You reconnect with your True Self, feeling lighter and free. 
  <br><br>
  Throughout life, you will begin to look at everyday circumstances easily and meet surprises calmly and with grace.
  <br><br>
  Question N ° 1: How do you feel when you wake up every morning?

  `<p>Live in unity
<br><br>
  In today's meditation, we talk about unity, as the basic truth of all that exists.
  <br><br>
  As individuals, we are not alike.  We have different lifestyles, beliefs and perceptions.
  <br><br>
  However, these differences exist only in the physical plane.
  <br><br>
  Whereas at the molecular and spiritual level, we are all one and are connected with the universal primary source.
  <br><br>
  When we begin to fully understand this concept of life in unity, the idea of ​​a personal “I” gives way to the image of a universal “I”.
  <br><br>
  The concept of rivalry and competition disappears. 
  <br><br>
  This relationship contributes to deep love and empathy for everyone who surrounds us.
  <br><br>
  QUESTION N ° 1: How would you define unity?
  <br><br>
  QUESTION N ° 2: What do you think of diversity?
  <br><br>
  QUESTION N ° 3: How did meditation help you realize the idea of ​​living in unity?

  Let us always remember:
  <br>
  “We all walk each other home”</p>`,
  `<p>

Write a letter to your country of origin.  In this letter, express all your feelings about it.

Remember that all of your feelings are valid and appropriate. Write everything that arises.

  Read the parable below and then write down your thoughts and feelings in your notebook.
<br><br>
Today please SHARE in the group - what is does the parable mean to you?
<br><br>
<strong>Parable</strong>
<br>
“This too shall pass”.
<br><br>
There was a king and he once said to the court sages - I have a ring with one of the finest diamonds in the world and I want to hide a message under the stone that can be useful in a situation of extreme despair.  I will give this ring to my heirs and I want it to serve faithfully.  Think of what kind of message will be there.  It must be very short to fit in the ring.
<br><br>
The sages knew how to write treatises, but did not express themselves in one short sentence.  They Thought and thought, but did not come up with anything.
<br><br>
The king complained about the failure of his venture to a faithful old servant who raised him from infancy and was part of the family.  And the old man said to him:
<br><br>
“I’m not a sage, I’m not educated, but I know such a message. For many years spent in the palace, I met a lot of people. And once I served a visiting mystic whom your father invited. And he gave me this message.  I ask that you don’t read it now. Save it under the stone and open it only when there’s no way out at all. The king listened to the old servant.
<br><br>
After some time, the enemies attacked the country and the king lost the war.  He fled on his horse and his enemies pursued him.  He was alone, his enemies were many. He rode to the end of the road.  There was a huge deep cliff before him, if he fell there, it is the end.  He could not go back, as the enemies were approaching. He already heard the clatter of their horses' hooves.  He had no way out.  He was in complete despair.
<br><br>
And then he remembered the ring.  He opened it and found an inscription: “This too shall pass”
<br><br>
After reading the message, he felt that everything was quiet.  Apparently the pursuers got lost and proceeded in the wrong direction. Horses were no longer heard.
<br><br>
The king was filled with gratitude to the servant and the unknown mystic. The words were powerful.  He closed the ring.  And set out on the road.  He gathered his army and returned his state.
<br><br>
On the day when he returned to the palace, they arranged a magnificent meeting, a feast for the whole world - the people loved their king. The king was happy and proud.
<br><br>
An old servant came up to him and said softly: “Even in this moment, look at the message again.”
<br><br>
The King said, “Now I am a winner, people are celebrating my return, I'm not in despair, not in a hopeless situation."
<br><br>
“Listen to this old servant,” the servant answered. “The message works not only in moments when everything is bad, but also in moments of victory.”
<br><br>
The king opened the ring and read:<br>
"This too shall pass."
<br><br>
And again he felt a silence fall over him, although he was in the midst of a noisy dancing crowd.  His pride dissolved.  He understood the message.  He was a wise man.
<br><br>
And then the old man said to the king; “Do you remember everything that happened to you? Nothing and no feeling is permanent. As night changes day, so moments of joy and despair replace each other. Accept them as the nature of things, as part of life”
<br><br>
Look at the events in your life (both good and not so good) while considering the words of the parable "This too shall pass."
<br><br>
Please write here in the group what thoughts and feelings you have about the meaning of the parable.

Today we look at the concept of luxury, adding to your life something that is much more significant than just a necessity.
<br><br>
When you feel that you are worthy to receive all the blessings that the Universe can offer you, your needs are satisfied easily and even more than necessary.  As soon as you learn to accept the grace that has been sent to you, you are showing the universe that you deserve only the best and are ready to receive it.
<br><br>
QUESTION N ° 1: How is luxury manifested in your life?
<br><br>
QUESTION N ° 2: What luxurious gifts do you present yourself?
<br><br>
QUESTION N ° 3: How can you bring luxury to others?

  Scroll through your journal, read the tasks you've performed.
<br><br>
See if there is something that you missed. Would you like to supplement anything in the light of your new awareness? 
<br><br>
After that, think about someone in your life and/or environment who seems to be unhappy or going through a challenging time. This person may complain often and have a generally negative view of life. 
<br><br>
It could be someone from the 7th day list or someone else.
<br><br>
Share the parable from Day 19 with this person and write down what happens in your journal. 
<br><br>
How did you feel sharing the parable  with him / her? What thoughts, associations, sensations arose in the process?
<br><br>
Did they answer? Did you talk about it, what did you discuss?
 <br><br>
You never know whose life you can impact and shift when you share with them what you’ve learned.

  `<p>You guys have been amazing to keep up with the rhythm.<br><br>
  Here we go for our final day to wrap up everything we have learned so far.
  <br><br>
  Are you familiar with the seven “switches” of happiness?
  <br>
 *Give to your neighbor<br>
 *Transmit (love & light)<br>
 *Let go (of things that do not serve you)<br>
 *Indulge (live life to the fullest)<br>
 *Give thanks<br>
 *Give yourself (be of service)<br>
 *Forgive<br>
 <br><br>
When these seven become part of our life, happiness will flow into it simply and easily.
<br><br>
Everything is energy and its flow must be circular and continuous in order to return abundance to us.  This is how the law of reciprocity works.
<br><br>
Energy current ↔️ influx/flow ↔️ money/abundance
<br><br>
Keep our channels open and clean so that our energy can flow unhindered! Remember to stay present. This is OUR time! 
<br><br>
Our future is in our own hands; we make choices and decisions every day, every moment.
<br><br>
How we use our  time, with whom we spend it, and how we feel at every moment determines our life.
<br><br>
<strong>Key Takeaways:</strong><br>
 *Awareness<br>
 *Gratitude<br>
 *Recognition of value & abundance
